    "In this second practical, we will train neural network models to obtain sentence representations. We can then use these sentence representations for a downstream task such as sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will help you to develop models for your experiments. But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.) Make sure your code corresponds to the description you give in the report; we will deduct points if this is not the case. **Make sure you run all your code before submitting the notebook, and do not leave unnecessary print statements / cells in your notebook that are not intended for the grader.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important!** The main purpose of this lab is for you to learn how to answer research questions by experimenting and then writing a scientific report.\n",

    "### Data set\n",
    "We will use the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) (SST), which provides sentences, their binary tree structure, and fine-grained sentiment scores.\n",
    "This dataset is different from the one we used in the first practical.\n",
    "In Practical 1, a review consisted of several sentences, and we had one sentiment score for the whole review. Now, a review consists of a single sentence, and we have a sentiment score for each node in the binary tree that makes up the sentence, including the root node (i.e., we still have an overall sentiment score for the entire review). We will look at an example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this practical we will only make use of the sentence tokens whereas in the second part we will also exploit the tree structure that is provided by the SST.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bag-of-words (BOW)\n",
    "- Continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)\n",
    "- Deep continuous bag-of-words (Deep CBOW)\n",

    "#### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sparsity and a small data set can cause *overfitting*. This is a phenomenom that is very likely to occur when training strong and expressive models, like LSTMs, on small data. In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dropout layer is defined by the following formula, which can be applied, for example, to a linear layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{tanh}(W(\\mathbf{h}\\odot \\mathbf{d}) + \\mathbf{b})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{d} \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$, with $d_j \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "These formula simply means that we *drop* certain parameters during training (by setting them to zero). Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

    "For your report, you are expected to answer research questions by doing further experiments.\n",

    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you cover at least the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How important is word order for this task?\n",
    "- Does the tree structure help to get a better accuracy?\n",
    "- How does performance depend on the sentence length? Compare the various models. Is there a model that does better on longer sentences? If so, why?\n",
    "- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring.\n",
    "    - Warning: NLTK's Tree function seems to result in invalid trees in some cases, so be careful if you want to parse the string to a tree structure before extraction the phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To be able to obtain a full grade (10), you should conduct further investigations.** For example, you can also investigate one the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When making a wrong prediction, can you figure out at what point in the tree (sentence) the model fails? You can make a prediction at each node to investigate.\n",
    "- How does N-ary Tree LSTM compare to the Child-Sum Tree LSTM?\n",
    "- How do the Tai et al. Tree LSTMs compare to Le & Zuidema's formulation?\n",
    "- Or... your own research question!\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples should give you an idea of the expected scope of your further investigations. The maximum number of points awarded for these further investigations depends on the depth of your analysis, and can also be awarded for one of the further research questions already listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***When you report numbers, please report the mean accuracy across 3 (or more) runs with different random seed, together with the standard deviation.*** This is because the final performance may vary per random seed.\n",
    "More precisely, you should run each model with 3 different seeds, and for each of these 3 runs, evaluate the best model (according to the validation) on the test dataset. The validation dataset is used for finding the best model over iterations, but the accuracy you report should be on the test dataset.\n",

    "General Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math notation – define each variable (either in running text, or in a pseudo-legenda after or before the equation).\n",
    "- Define technical terminology you need.\n",
    "- Avoid colloquial language – everything can be said in a scientific-sounding way.\n",
    "- Avoid lengthy sentences, stay to the point.\n",
    "- Do not spend space on \"obvious\" things.\n",
    "- Do not go over the page limit. (We will deduct points for that.)\n",
    "- The page limit is 4 pages excluding references and appendix. This is a strict limit; points will be deducted for longer reports.\n",
    "- There is no strict limit to references and appendix. However, the report needs to remain fully self-contained: the appendix should only include content that is not necessary to understand your work. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of your work can be put into the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal report:\n",
    "- Precise, scientific, technical, to the point\n",
    "  - Little general “waffle”/chit-chat\n",
    "- Not boring – because you don’t explain obvious things too much\n",
    "- Efficient delivery of (only) the facts that we need to know to understand/reimplement\n",
    "- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results\n",
    "- Insightful analysis – speculation should connect to something interesting and not be too much; the reader “learns something new”\n",
    "- No typos, no colloquialisms – well-considered language\n",
    "- This normally means several re-draftings (re-orderings of information)\n"
